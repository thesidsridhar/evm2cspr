## Strategic Objective

The strategic objective of this grant is to support the continuing work of an eventual EVM on Casper.  Casper should provide us with a grant in order to facilitate the development and implementation of Fenton, a project that brings the power and reach of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to the Casper blockchain. With this integration, the Casper ecosystem will benefit from faster transaction processing, reduced costs, and compatibility with an extensive array of existing Ethereum dApps, NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi, all without necessitating code modifications.

With this important first step, we aim to make the Casper blockchain even more attractive to developers, users, and businesses. We intend to leverage the established tools, applications, and the considerable user base of the EVM, while offering the unique advantages of Casper's high throughput, low transaction fees, and energy efficiency. We plan to preserve compatibility with essential EVM dApp tools, such as Solidity, Metamask, Remix, Truffle, and more, thus creating a seamless transition for developers and users from Ethereum to Casper.
