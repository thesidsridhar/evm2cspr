# EVM â†’ CASPER

`evm2cspr` is a project for compiling EVM bytecode into wasm bytecode, with the particular goal of having that wasm artifact be executable on the [Casper blockchain](https://casper.network/en-us/).
For ease of testing locally, `evm2cspr` also currently supports [wasi](https://wasi.dev/) as a target platform.
The wasi output can be run locally using a wasm runtime, for example [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/).
This can be useful for debugging contracts without deploying to cspr.

Even though `evm2cspr` is a general EVM bytecode to wasm bytecode transpiler, the CLI interface accepts a Solidity source file as input for convenience.
The source file is compiled to EVM bytecode using [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity).
Using Solidity and `solc`, means `evm2cspr` also has access to the contract ABI.
This allows the output wasm artifact to contain functions that match the ones given in the contract.
For example, `test/calc.sol` contains a contract with a function `multiply(int a, int b)`, and the compiled wasm artifact will also contain a function called `multiply` which takes a JSON string as input.
The JSON input is expected to be an object with fields matching the function argument names (`a` and `b` in the example).
These functions generated based on the ABI are in addition to a general function called `execute`, which accepts binary input following the usual Solidity ABI (i.e. the first four bytes are the "selector" derived from the function signature, the remaining bytes are the input arguments encoded using Solidity's ABI format).

## Usage

### Compiling to wasi (for running locally)

```
./evm2cspr INPUT_SOLIDITY_CONTRACT -o OUTPUT_WASM_FILE -b wasi
```

Example:

```console
./evm2cspr test/calc.sol -o calc.wasm -b wasi
```

Running the output in wasmtime:

```console
wasmtime --allow-unknown-exports calc.wasm --invoke multiply -- '{"a":6, "b": 7}'
```

### Compiling to cspr

```
./evm2cspr INPUT_SOLIDITY_CONTRACT -o OUTPUT_WASM_FILE -b cspr
```

Example:

```console
./evm2cspr test/calc.sol -o calc.wasm -b cspr
```
