# EVM â†’ CASPER

`evm2cspr` is a project for compiling EVM bytecode into wasm bytecode, with the particular goal of having that wasm artifact be executable on the [Casper blockchain](https://casper.network/en-us/).
For ease of testing locally, `evm2cspr` also currently supports [wasi](https://wasi.dev/) as a target platform.
The wasi output can be run locally using a wasm runtime, for example [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/).
This can be useful for debugging contracts without deploying to cspr.

Even though `evm2cspr` is a general EVM bytecode to wasm bytecode transpiler, the CLI interface accepts a Solidity source file as input for convenience.
The source file is compiled to EVM bytecode using [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity).
This way, evm2cspr is able to access the contract ABI, which allows for the output wasm artifact to feature functions that correspond to those provided in the contract. For instance, the contract in `test/calc.sol` comprises a function `multiply(int a, int b)`, and the resulting wasm artifact will also include a similarly named multiply function that accepts a JSON string as input. The JSON input should be an object with fields matching the names of function arguments (a and b in this case). Along with these ABI-derived functions, there's also a generic execute function that accepts binary input conforming to the typical Solidity ABI format (meaning the initial four bytes are the function signature-derived "selector", while the remaining bytes represent the input arguments encoded using Solidity's ABI format).

## Usage

### Compiling to wasi (for running locally)

```
./evm2cspr INPUT_SOLIDITY_CONTRACT -o OUTPUT_WASM_FILE -b wasi
```

Example:

```console
./evm2cspr test/calc.sol -o calc.wasm -b wasi
```

Running the output in wasmtime:

```console
wasmtime --allow-unknown-exports calc.wasm --invoke multiply -- '{"a":6, "b": 7}'
```

### Compiling to cspr

```
./evm2cspr INPUT_SOLIDITY_CONTRACT -o OUTPUT_WASM_FILE -b cspr
```

Example:

```console
./evm2cspr test/calc.sol -o calc.wasm -b cspr
```
