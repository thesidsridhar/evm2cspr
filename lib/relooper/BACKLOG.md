# Here will be a list of potential improvements.
1) Rewrite domination tree building algorithm.
     There is an algorithm with better time complexety but much harder to implement.
2) Find optimal order of split and merge in reducing algorithm
     Different orders generate different graphs and different graphs provide different performance (both gas and time)
     of output programs
